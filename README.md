# DeveAppMaximizer
A tool to fix the issue with the Logitech G Keys keyboard where it is not always opening an application maximized.

Some other advantages of my application are the use of a modern programming language (debatable I know :smile:) C#. And having fully automated builds and releases using AppVeyor and Chocolatey:
